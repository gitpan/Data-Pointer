Data/Pointer version 0.61
=========================

Have you ever used pointers in C? Well then using this module should be pretty
straight-forward. It implements the basic set of pointer operations which I
thought to be useful. Currently 4 of the basic perl data types are implemented
(which are SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH and IO) and should behave in an intuitive
manner which is also documented in their respective docs.
